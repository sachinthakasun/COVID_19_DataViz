# COVID_19_DataViz
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Visualization Project. In this data analytics endeavor, we delve into the intricacies of COVID-19 data spanning from December 2019 to September 2021, with a primary focus on vaccination and death statistics. Leveraging SQL queries, we meticulously sift through vast datasets, distilling valuable insights and trends. Our project involves the extraction, transformation, and creation of new datasets to empower meaningful visualizations. Using Tableau, we translate raw data into engaging and informative visuals that shed light on the pandemic's progression. Join us in exploring this project to gain a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact and the progress made through vaccination efforts.
